The Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) is conducting an evaluation of its Discovery Research Program. This is a routine evaluation that will assess the Discovery Research Program's relevance, effectiveness and efficiency required as per the Treasury Board Policy on Results and section 42.1 of the Financial Administration Act (FAA). The evaluation will focus on the extent to which the Discovery Research Program supports excellence and the extent to which the Discovery Research suite of grants and supplements adds value in addressing the needs of the research community.

The Discovery Research suite of programs includes Individual Discovery Grants and the following:

the supplements (Ship Time, Northern Research, and Discovery Accelerator Supplements),
the Research Tools and Instruments Grants,
the Canadian Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics Support Grant,
the Subatomic Physics Funding Mechanisms (Subatomic Physics Individual and Project Discovery Grants, Subatomic Physics Research Tools and Instruments -RTI, Categories 1, 2 and 3-, Subatomic Physics Major Resources Support) and
the Mathematics and Statistics Funding Mechanisms (Mathematics and Statistics Individual Discovery Grants and Collaborative and Thematic Resources in Mathematics and Statistics).
As a key component of the evaluation, NSERC has commissioned Circum Network Inc. to conduct an online survey of researchers who received funding from the Discovery Research Program. The input that you will provide in this survey is an important element in the evaluation process and will help NSERC better understand the impact of the Discovery Research Program and how to better serve the research community.

CONFIDENTIALITY

Participation in this survey is voluntary. The survey will take approximately 30 minutes to complete. However, your funding history may influence the time required to answer it. At the end of the survey, you will have an opportunity to provide any additional feedback and comments about the Discovery Research Program.

Your responses will be kept strictly confidential. When you log on, the system will link your responses to a temporary database containing data about you and your NSERC Discovery funding history. These data have been downloaded from the NSERC grants database for your convenience.

All analyses will be conducted at an aggregate level. Personal identifiers, such as your name and NSERC Personal Identification Number, will not be used at any stage. Please be assured that any combinations of data that could potentially be used to identify particular respondents in the context of an opinion survey are protected under the federal Privacy Act. No information that might directly or indirectly reveal your identity will be released or published without your specific consent to the disclosure.

LOGISTICS

You must provide an answer to every question, but every question offers you a choice to select "Do not know/No response" or "No comments".
Your answers as well as your position in the survey are saved every time you click the "Next Page" button. You can leave the survey by simply closing the browser window after having clicked "Next Page" to save your most recent answers.
You can return to the survey by using the same Web address and access code you were given initially; you will be brought back to the question you were seeing when you last closed the survey.
You can toggle between the English and the French versions of this survey by clicking on the language button below.
If you experience any difficulties logging in or completing the survey, please contact Circum Network Inc., at b1201@circum.com or 1-855-979-7899. If you have questions about the evaluation of the Discovery Research Program, you may also contact Geneviève Félix, Senior Program Evaluation Officer, Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, at evaluation@nserc-crsng.gc.ca.

Effectiveness of the Discovery Research Suite of Grants and Supplements in Addressing the Needs of the Research Community

The next few questions solicit your views regarding the incremental impact of the Discovery Research suite of grants and supplements and more specifically:

the Subatomic Physics Funding Mechanisms (Subatomic Physics Individual and Project Discovery Grants, Subatomic Physics Research Tools and Instruments -RTI, Categories 1, 2 and 3-, Subatomic Physics Major Resources Support) and
the Mathematics and Statistics Funding Mechanisms (the Mathematics and Statistics Discovery Grants and Collaborative and Thematic Resources in Mathematics and Statistics)
While answering questions in this section, please concentrate only on the funding coming through the Mathematics and Statistics funding mechanisms.

The Mathematics and Statistics funding mechanisms include the Discovery Grants budget for Evaluation Group 1508 (Mathematics and Statistics) as well as the budget for the Collaborative and Thematic Resources Support in Mathematics and Statistics (CTRMS), through which the Institutes are supported. As recommended in the 2012 Math-Stats Long Range Plan (2013-2018), since 2014 the Mathematics and Statistics Discovery Grants have received approximately 81% of the Mathematics and Statistics funding mechanisms while the CTRMS has received the remaining 19%. The amount of funding within this mechanism was initially set in 2014 based on an analysis of past support to the currently funded Institutes and to the Mathematics and Statistics Discovery Grants. The Mathematics and Statistics Discovery Grants Liaison Committee (MSLC) has a mandate to advise on budget allocation principles and on the management of the NSERC Mathematics and Statistics funding mechanisms as a whole.

To what extent do you agree or disagree with the following statements.

\(1-7 for agreement love, or Do Not Know/ no response)

The decision to divide the funds awarded through the Mathematics and Statistics funding mechanisms in the ratio of 81% to Discovery Grants and 19% to CTRMS was appropriate.								
The current funding mechanisms have proven to be valuable to the Mathematics and Statistics research community.								
The Mathematics and Statistics research community is characterised by a high degree of interconnection and collaboration among research groups on the national and international stages.								
The Mathematics and Statistics funding mechanisms should provide the possibility of exchanging funds between the various elements in order to reflect the priorities of the community and the pressure it may face at a given time.								
Given the same budgetary envelope, NSERC should prioritize Individual Discovery Grants over funding for the Institutes.								
Given the same budgetary envelope, NSERC should prioritize funding for the Institutes over Individual Discovery Grants.								
The approach to the Mathematics and Statistics funding mechanisms needs to be restructured to meet the current needs of the research community.

How does the Discovery Research Program Support the New Generation of Researchers? 
 
The next few questions solicit your views regarding support to Early-Career Researchers. Early Career Researchers (ECR) are applicants who have held an independent academic position for 3 years or less and who meet the NSERC Eligibility Criteria for Faculty at the time of submitting the Notification of Intent to Apply for a Discovery Grant (NOI). As an example, to be classified as an ECR, a researcher submitting an NOI in August 2018 would have been hired on or after July 2015. 
 
The three-year window for being considered an ECR can be adjusted to account for instances where a researcher has had an acceptable delay in research or period of inactivity (illness, parental leave, etc.). As an example, a researcher submitting an NOI in August 2018 and who took a seven-month parental leave within the past three years must have been hired on or after December 2014 in order to be considered an ECR. 
 
Do you consider yourself an Early-Career Researcher?
